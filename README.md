# Continuous Training and Deployment Pipeline

## Project Overview
This project implements a continuous training and deployment pipeline for a transformer-based text classification model using a dataset provided in the `data` folder. It includes monitoring for model staleness, email notifications, and a Streamlit UI for interaction.

## Folder Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset for training and evaluation.
- `model/`: Scripts for training, inference, and email alerts.
- `monitoring/`: Scripts for monitoring staleness and visualizing metrics.
- `pipeline/`: Data preprocessing and model utility scripts.
- `ui/`: Streamlit app for user interaction.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required packages.

# Features
- Continuous training and deployment pipeline.
- Advanced model staleness detection.
- Email notifications for model staleness.
- Streamlit UI for predictions and metrics visualization
